This package was debianized by Norbert Preining <preining@debian.org> on
Thu, 23 Aug 2007 18:38:31 +0200.

The following TeX Live packages were downloaded from 
    http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive/
and merged into one orig.tar.gz file:
    tex-gyre.tar.xz
    tex-gyre.doc.tar.xz
    tex-gyre-math.tar.xz
    tex-gyre-math.doc.tar.xz
This is done with the script debian/make-orig-tar

% the LaTeX Project Team and other feedback, of the GUST Font License.
% (GUST is the Polish TeX Users Group, http://www.gust.org.pl)
%
% For the most recent version of this license see

% 1) it is requested, but not legally required, that derived works be
%    distributed only after changing the names of the fonts comprising this

%    files comprising the Work, as listed in the manifest, also be given
%    new names. Any exceptions to this request are also given in the
